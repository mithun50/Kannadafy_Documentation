## Disclaimer âš 

*Important Note: **Kannadafy* does *not* provide a reverse process. Once a Python script is obfuscated using Kannada letters, *there is no built-in way to de-obfuscate or reverse the process* back to the original source code.

This tool is meant purely for fun, learning, and experimentation. If you need to keep a backup of your original code, please make sure to store it in a safe place before obfuscating it. ðŸ˜„


The Author`s are working on deobfuscation process. It will be roll out soon.....
